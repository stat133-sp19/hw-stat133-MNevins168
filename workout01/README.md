# Workout 01

This homework project was designed to allow me, the student, to display competence over basic data importing and manipulation, ggplot2, git, and general file system work for data for five different Golden State Warriors players. Additionally this project is the first to implement importing to GitHub and multiple files in a project, as well as a mandatory writeup for the data.
